#### Tarot: Death, Reversed

TLDR:
* Find NOBODY's journal, learn the [Cube](../../Elements-of-the-Prophecy/7-The-Cube.md) is likely in [Deimos's](../../../-Sacrosanct/Characters/Daren.md) pyramid.
* [Leon](../../Characters/Leon.md) and [Raiden](../../Characters/Raiden.md) are assigned to steal the cube.
* The party plans to attack [Deimos](../../../-Sacrosanct/Characters/Daren.md) w/ gathered allies.
