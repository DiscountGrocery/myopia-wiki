His skin is a desaturated dark pink, lacerated in intricate patterns, scarred over with a metallic sheen, accented by burn marks.

A bronze amulet of the gatekeepers rests around his neck, thrumming with planar energy.

Leathery brown hair and clothing are accented by eyes that shine like gold. 
Hands covered in metallic shavings.
