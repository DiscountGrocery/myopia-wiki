### General <i class="ri-checkbox-blank-line"></i>
Duck is a naive yet charming changeling, with extraordinary performance abilities.

He is empathetic yet self-absorbed, and usually very impulsive. He is obsessed with impressing other people.

While in his changeling form, Duck is average height, with somewhat lanky proportions. His skin is snow white and his hair is curly and ash-gray. His eyes often lack pupils. However, his form is subject to the desire of his shape-shifting abilities.

Duck's attire is a ['shiftweave'](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Shiftweave) toga and waist cape, usually colored a deep Saxe blue. Duck's fashion sense is gaudy and extravagant, always manipulating his shiftweave to dress the part. Other common accessories include: a golden cape and sandals.

	<summary>1010 - 1015 YK</summary>
	<p><br>
	Duck regained consciousness, with no memory but his nickname, in 1010 YK, and gained the affection of a struggling music-store owner, Staedtler Fischer. The two became close friends, and Duck began to support the store in exchange for a place to stay.

Duck learned the ins and outs of the music scene in [Sharn](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Sharn.) and learned to stay hidden using personas sustained through his shape-shifting abilities. 

After garnering large audiences, some of Duck's popular elven personas caught the attention of [House Phiarlan](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Phiarlan). Parasitical Relationships formed with the naive Duck until local conflict escalated between House Phiarlan and [House Thuranni](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Thuranni). Duck's mentor was accidentally killed in the crossfire, and Duck presumed his identity to withdraw and protect himself.

Years passed and Duck subsisted on low-paying gigs and worship of [the Traveler](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Traveler).
