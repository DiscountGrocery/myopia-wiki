### General <i class="ri-checkbox-blank-line"></i>

Sisava is a threatening and ruthless Yuan-ti assassin, accorded by a divine purpose.

They are cold, self-serving, and manipulative, often acting without regard to morality or empathy.

They are an avatar of the Mockery, a deity of the Dark Six, and assigned to assassinate other 'avatars' of other Dark Six deities. A ritual is performed with their corpse which increases Sisava's power.
