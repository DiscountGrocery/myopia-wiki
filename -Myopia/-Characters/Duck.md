### General
Duck is a naive yet charming changeling, with extraordinary performance abilities.

While in his true changeling form, Duck is average height, with somewhat lanky proportions. His skin is snow white and his hair is curly and ash-gray. His eyes are stark and stormy. He is very fit, and his muscles are smooth. However, his form is subject to the desire of his shape-shifting abilities.

Duck is empathetic yet egotistical, in the same vein as that to a child. This reflects the fact that his memory only stretches back 5 years.

### History
**Pre:**
Currently, not much is known about Duck's past. 

Duck gained consciousness in 1007 YK, and gained the affection of a struggling music-store owner, Staedtler Fischer. The two became close friends, and Duck began to support the store in exchange for a place to stay. 

Duck learned the ins and outs of the music scene in [Sharn](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Sharn.) and learned to stay hidden using personas sustained through his shape-shifting abilities. 

After garnering large audiences, some of Duck's popular elven personas caught the attention of [House Phiarlan](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Phiarlan). Parasitical relationships formed with the naive Duck until local conflict escalated between House Phiarlan and [House Thuranni](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Thuranni). Duck's mentor was accidentally killed in the crossfire, and Duck presumed his identity to withdraw and protect himself from the conflict.

Years passed and Duck subsisted through low-paying gigs and worship of [the Traveler](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Traveler).

**Story:**
Duck is introduced as Staedtler.

[One day,](../-Session-Notes/Session-1--And-their-shadows-will%20spread-like-oil.md) Duck stumbles across Maylyn (neither recognize each other due to memory suppression by powerful [enchantment magic](../../-Sacrosanct/Machine-of-Enchantment.md)) She offers a job as an agent for the Looking Glass, which Duck accepts out of boredom and beliefs related to the Traveler.

Duck learns to fight, incorporating his musical ability into inspiration for his peers.

In [Session 4](../-Session-Notes/Session-4--Phantom-of-the-Opera.md), Duck finds a powerful musical artifact, [Phil](../-Items/Phil.md), that responds only to his touch.

Duck's identity as a changeling is kept secret until [Session 10](../-Session-Notes/Session-10--This-is-Where-it-All-Falls-Apart.md).
