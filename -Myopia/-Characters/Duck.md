### General
Duck, a player character in Myopia, is a naive yet charming changeling, with extraordinary performance abilities.

While in his true changeling form, Duck is average height, with somewhat lanky proportions. His skin is snow white and his hair is curly and ash-gray. His eyes are stark and stormy gray. However, his form is subject to the desire of his shape-shifting abilities.

Duck's attire is a ['shiftweave'](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Shiftweave) toga and waist cape, usually colored a deep Saxe blue. Duck's fashion sense is gaudy and extravagant, always manipulating his shiftweave to dress the part. Other accessories include: a golden cape, sandals, and under-armor.

Duck is empathetic yet egotistical, in the same vein as that to a child. This reflects the fact that his memory only stretches back 5 years.

### History
#### **Pre:**

Currently, not much is known about Duck's past. 

Duck gained consciousness in 1007 YK, and gained the affection of a struggling music-store owner, Staedtler Fischer. The two became close friends, and Duck began to support the store in exchange for a place to stay. 

Duck learned the ins and outs of the music scene in [Sharn](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Sharn.) and learned to stay hidden using personas sustained through his shape-shifting abilities. 

After garnering large audiences, some of Duck's popular elven personas caught the attention of [House Phiarlan](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Phiarlan). Parasitical relationships formed with the naive Duck until local conflict escalated between House Phiarlan and [House Thuranni](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Thuranni). Duck's mentor was accidentally killed in the crossfire, and Duck presumed his identity to withdraw and protect himself.

Years passed and Duck subsisted on low-paying gigs and worship of [the Traveler](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Traveler).

#### **Story:**

Duck is introduced as Staedtler.
In [Session 1](../-Session-Notes/Session-1--And-their-shadows-will%20spread-like-oil.md), Duck stumbles across Maylyn (neither recognize each other due to memory suppression by powerful [enchantment magic](../../-Sacrosanct/Machine-of-Enchantment.md)) She offers a job as an agent for the Looking Glass, which Duck accepts out of boredom and beliefs related to the Traveler.

Duck learns to fight, incorporating his musical ability into inspiration for his peers.

In [Session 4](../-Session-Notes/Session-4--Phantom-of-the-Opera.md), Duck finds a powerful musical artifact, [Phil](../-Items/Phil.md), that responds only to his touch.

Duck's identity as a changeling is kept secret until [Session 10](../-Session-Notes/Session-10--This-is-Where-it-All-Falls-Apart.md). 

Duck re-meets the forgotten prince in [Session 23](../-Session-Notes/Session-23--All-Along-the-Clocktower.md).

Duck manifests an [aberrant mark](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aberrant_dragonmark) in [Session 44](../-Session-Notes/Session-44--Into-the-Hallow.md).

Duck's mask is permanently scarred by Phoen [Session 55](../-Session-Notes/Session-55--Schism.md)

### Ability

As a changeling, Duck can take the form of any humanoid.

Duck has demonstrated proficiency in occult magic, which he uses to heal and support in combat.

The Forgotten Prince protects Duck from death by taking control of his body (represented by an ethereal mask), as well as enhancing his magic ability.
