- In-character recap of previous session.
- Duck talks to [Tonik](../../-Characters/Tonik.md) about the [Clock-Hand](../../-Items/Clock-Hand.md) and about his hesitation to give [The-Forgotten-Prince](../../-Characters/The-Forgotten-Prince.md) what he wants.

***
* The collected rings are examined to be magical: fire resistance, and maniacal devices.

* [Pharen](../../-Characters/-Player/Pharen.md) constructs a device more capable of sustaining Vrennan.
* Duck talks to Tonik, tells him about [The-Feeling-of-Being-Stabbed](../../-Characters/The-Feeling-of-Being-Stabbed.md)'s saying that there are 4 Forgotten princes. Tonik's whirring is extraordinary loud.

***

* The Prince has created a mindscape of Tonik's mind similar to Maylyn's in [Session-20--Degenerate](-4-Bees-made-honey-in-the-lions-skull/Session-20--Degenerate.md), which we will traverse through to experience his memory.
* A [glowing needle](../../../-Sacrosanct/Machine-of-Enchantment.md), appears.
